Project 1
==============

Given a grid world of at least 10 squares, this program will solve a global localization problem given a sequence of sensory input of a robot. In other words, the program will be able to:

* Allow a user to input a sequence of sensory input of a robot
* Calculate for this sequence the probabilites of a robot being in each square of the grid
* Output the largest probabilities and corresponding locations
